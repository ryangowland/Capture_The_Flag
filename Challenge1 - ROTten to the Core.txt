Those of you who are taking computer science classes in school may at this point be thinking, ok, we’ve got this sorted. We’re already being taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough. You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff in classes. You can do well in computer science classes without ever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a degree in computer science from a top university and still not be any good at programming. That’s why tech companies all make you take a coding test before they’ll hire you, regardless of where you went to university or how well you did there. They know grades and exam results prove nothing. key{4a247351c63a867bf26d505d095c37284efc3802087bacac363a418184cc7506} https://paulgraham.com/google.html
